"""DifferentialLab — numerical ODE, difference equation, and PDE solving application.

This package provides:
- ODE solving via SciPy (solve_ivp, solve_bvp)
- Difference equation (recurrence) solving
- 2D PDE solving (elliptic, finite difference)
- Vector ODE support with animation
- Function transforms (Fourier, Laplace, Taylor, Hilbert, Z-transform)
- Configuration, plotting, and GUI modules
